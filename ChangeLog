ChangeLog for Chisel v2.2.29

#545 Avoid java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: empty.init when no uncommented ports
#471 An explicit clock for a node should override the explicit reset for a component.
#459 Don't reserve empty names. Slight change to pr499 - ignore attempts to reserve empty names.
 Fix error message; remove unused code (that triggers deprecation warning).
 Fix a bug in obj id construction
 Pass vcd & vpd filenames as arguments
 Allow comparison of Node with null.
 Fix vpi_put_value timing
 Change nameable to Nameable, move setName to Nameable, scope changes
 Fix typo (spelling).
 Comments and slight modifications to ChiselUtil
 Replace gen: T with gen: => T in Vec and Mem constructors and factories. This seems more general and removes the need for a cloneType method on Bundles. Update internal Vec/Mem usage to eliminate deprecation warnings (incomplete - Mem() -> SeqMem() doesn't work since SeqMem() doesn't support an apply() method).
 Make sure bfs & dfs visit each node only once
 Backend is not abstract now, so NullBackend is not needed
 Consistent naming for keywords
 Support force to put values on nets in verilog sim
 Incorporate Chris's Queue flow and pipe definitions.
 Move static class definitions into a class object to placate Scala compiler.
 addNode: api for module resolution in custom transforms
 Correct error in Queue documentation
 Provide a template to reuse tester transactions
 Swapped arguments (out,n) in Vec and Mem.
 Queue example was not for the object but for class Queue
 Make poke(id, v), peek(id) private
 Mask the value in dat_from_hex to get the correct value
 Disallow Chisel2-style masked writes for SeqMem
 Pass reference for put_value
 Fix vcd recording for mem
 Fix poke bug for long data
 Allow for SeqMems to be named via reflection
 Remove hasMem flag
 Add Chisel3-compatible SeqMem masked writes
 Error checking for shift register, negitive number resulted in stack overflow
 Fixed vcdMem regression introduced in v28.
 Replace overridden setName in seqMem with a working setMemName method
 Change nameable to Nameable, move setName to Nameable, scope changes
