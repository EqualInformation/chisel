ReleaseNotes for Chisel v2.2.19 10/3/14

This release of Chisel adds support for:
 - design parameters
 - 0-width wires
 - C++ backend compilation performance

We are introducing experimental support to Chisel to allow module
designers to specify design parameters that should be configured on
the fly as the design is elaborated. We provide support for looking up
parameter values within Chisel Modules and Bundles, as well as scoping
where certain parameter values are defined and customizing how
dependent parameters are calculated. Users can define custom
ChiselConfiguration classes which override default parameter values,
and they can select which configuration to use at runtime via the
Chisel command line. We allow constraints to be placed on parameter
values and provide hooks for automated design space exploration of
parameter spaces. A detailed guide to these experimental features is
available at in the Chisel repo at chisel/doc/parameters/parameters.pdf

0-width wire support attempts to eliminate 0-width wires from the
design by either replacing them with the appropriate identity element,
or by removing them entirely. This feature is highly experimental and
is controlled by the --W0W command line option to Chisel.

The C++ backend changes attempt to improve compilation performance by
reducing the size of the functions generated by the C++ backend. This
feature is highly experimental and is controlled by a number of Chisel
command line options. The following options are either treated as
simple binary feature enablers, or take an <Integer> argument
specifying the value of some optional feature.

--allocateOnlyNeededShadowRegisters
  (C++ backend) Attempt to allocate only those shadow registers
  actually required. This reduces the size of the main C++ design
  object (especially when --shadowRegisterInObject is enabled), which
  in turn reduces compilation time. It should have no execution-time
  performance impact.

--compileInitializationUnoptimized
  (C++ backend) Compile initialization code at -O0, rarely used code
  at -O1.

--isVCDinline
  (C++ backend) Generate VCD dump code without goto branches. Allows
  compiling smaller VCD dump functions, reducing C++ compile
  times. This will have some impact on execution-time performance.

--lineLimitFunctions <Integer>
  (C++ backend) Limit the number of lines in a C++ function/method
  before splitting it up into multiple functions to reduce C++ compile
  times. The <Integer> value specifies a loose upper limit on the
  number of lines output to a single function before that function is
  split up into smaller functions. This involves a trade-off between
  compile-time performance and execution-time performance. Smaller
  functions yield faster compile times, but result in slower execution
  since instead of calling a single function, calls to multiple
  functions are generated. Reasonable values for this argument would
  be in the range from 256 to 2048.

--minimumLinesPerFile <Integer>
  (C++ backend) Limit the minimum number of lines per file so as not
  to produce trivial files. This works in conjunction with
  --lineLimitFunctions to break up a massive single file into
  multiple smaller (but not too small) files. Reasonable values for
  this argument would be in the range of 1024 to 32768.

--parallelMakeJobs <Integer>
  (C++ backend) Generate a Makefile to compile multiple C++ files in
  parallel. The <Integer> argument specifies the amount of parallelism
  (the argument to the -j option to make). A value of -1 indicates
  that no value will be passed with the -j argument to make, which in
  turn should inform make not to limit the number of jobs that can run
  simultaneously.

--partitionIslands
  (C++, dot backends) Partition the graph into islands of
  combinatorial logic that may be compiled and executed in parallel. 

--shadowRegisterInObject
  (C++ backend) Allocate shadow registers in the global emulation
  object (as opposed to the local clock procedures). This is
  automatically enabled when --lineLimitFunctions is in effect.
